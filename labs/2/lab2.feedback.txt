Andrew, 

About your programs...

Functionality

- The output does not follow instructions given by program. 

- Problem 3.11 is wrong. If I enter month 2 and year 2012, your program tells me that it
  has 28 days, which is incorrect! Also, case statements need to be indented two
  spaces to the right.  -1pt

- Problem 4.15 is wrong. Why are you comparing lower case letter to upper case? (see line
  49).  -1pt

Please make sure you read the problems well; follow instructions.


Style Check

- There is incorrect indentation. 

- Incorrect positioning of opening braces (see else statement)

- Some class names do not start with capital letter. They must.


Please make sure you follow the style guidelines. Penalties will be higher as
the semester moves forward.


Peace,

- Dr. Rivas
