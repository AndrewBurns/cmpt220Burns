Andrew,

About your programs...

Functionality

- All programs function correctly as required.


Style Check

- You used tabs, which is forbidden. See SumDigits.java line 34. -1pt

- There is incorrect indentation. See SumDigits.java line 34. -1pt

Please make sure you follow the style guidelines. Penalties will be higher as
the semester moves forward.
