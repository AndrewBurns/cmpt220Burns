Andrew,

About your programs...

Functionality

- Could not test functionality of everything because a program cannot be
  compiled.  -1pt

Please make sure you read the problems well; follow instructions.


Style Check

- There is incorrect indentation. (See Selection line 50-51)  -1pt

Please make sure you follow the style guidelines and that your programs can be
compiled using javac. Penalties will be higher as the semester moves forward.

Peace,

- Dr. Rivas
