Andrew,

About your programs...

Functionality

- All programs function correctly as required.


Style Check

- Some class names do not start with capital letter. They must.

Please make sure you follow the style guidelines. Penalties will be higher as
the semester moves forward.

Peace,

- Dr. Rivas
