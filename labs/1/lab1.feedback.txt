Andrew,

About your essay...

- Good content
- Good length
- Good spelling and grammar



About your program...

Functionality

- Could not test functionality because programs cannot be compiled. Root cause
  seems to be the fact that the name of the file does not match the name of
  your class.  -1pt


Style Check

- All programs are missing the header: -1pt
  /**
   * file: SinglyLinkedList.java
   * author: student name
   * course: CMPT 220
   * assignment: project 1
   * due date: August 30, 2003
   * version: 1.3
   * 
   * This file contains the declaration of the SinglyLinkedList abstract data
   * type.
   */

- You used tabs, which is forbidden. -1pt

- There is incorrect indentation. -1pt

- Most class names do not start with capital letter. They must.


Please make sure you follow the style guidelines and that your programs can be
compiled using javac. Penalties will be higher as the semester moves forward.

Peace,

- Dr. Rivas
