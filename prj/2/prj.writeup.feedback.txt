The project attempts to make people passwords more secure from dictionary
attacks. The idea has good merit. 

However, there are some issues...
Writeup:
- There are typos in the document. -1pt

- It does not follow the structure required. Abstract, Introduction, etc. -1pt

Code:
- It is not user friendly. It asks the user for a password and then it
  complains that is not long enough, or that it needs x and y. It would be
  better to ask the user for these things upfront. -1pt

- There are typos or gramatical errors. -1pt

- There is incorrect indentation. -1pt
